# Unexpected Error Accessing Vals in Scala Classes

This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Scala related to accessing vals within a class. While vals are immutable, directly accessing them might lead to compilation errors. This is due to the way vals are handled by the Scala compiler in terms of encapsulation and method access.

The solution involves understanding the difference between vals and vars and using appropriate accessor methods when needed. This example showcases both scenarios with clear explanations.
